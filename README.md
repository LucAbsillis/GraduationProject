Goal: To sequence music by similarities between files using two metrics : bpm and tonality<br/>
--Goal 1: Determine the tonality of an mp3 file using the krumhansl-schmuckler Formula<br/>
--Goal 2: Determine the bpm by analyzing decibel spikes<br/>
--Goal 3: Sequence music by creating a similarity metric.<br/>
